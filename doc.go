Package protorpc implements a Protobuf-RPC ClientCodec and ServerCodec
for the net/rpc package.

To install it, you must first have Go (version 1) installed
(see http://golang.org/doc/install). Next, install the standard
protocol buffer implementation from http://github.com/google/protobuf/;
you must be running version 2.3 or higher.

Finally run

	go get github.com/cgrates/protobufc

to install the support library and protocol compiler.

Thanks!
